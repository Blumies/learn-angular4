# Lesson 1 - All the "new" things: ES6, TypeScript, Angular CLI

## Introduction
- [NodeJS]() is a JavaScript interpreter outside the browser - it allows you to run JavaScript on the "server"
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) is the Node Package Manager, it is included with NodeJS to allow you to install and manage JavaScript "modules" or packages
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is a slightly improved version of NPM 
- **[Angular 4](https://angular.io)** is the latest version of Angular. ( Angular 4 = Angular, Angular 1 = AngularJS )
- Angular 4 similar concepts to Angular 1 but it includes a lot of learning from the past 7 years 
- It uses some of latest JavaScript features ( see ES6 also called ES2015 ) 
- ES = [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) = The specification for languages that include JavaScript
- Each year a new specification comes out, with new features 
- [ES6](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) is just JavaScript - with new features and ammendments to the JavaScript language ( see links below )
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is also JavaScript - with annotated Types. This makes it easier to catch some bugs at "compile time" instead of "run time"
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) is a Command Line Interface for generating, running and testing Angular apps/components

## Prerequisites 

- [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v6 or greater
- [Install Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) 

## Getting started with Angular 4 using the CLI 

- Open a command line window ( cmd )
- Create a new Angular4 project 
```
ng new my-app
cd my-app
ng serve 
```
- This creates a new Angular 4 app called in directory my-app
- ```ng serve``` starts a webserver that bundles your JS modules with "hot reloading" that changes as you save your code
